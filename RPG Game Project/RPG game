Since this RPG game is an online game, we need a Client class and a Server class to provide users connect to the server. 
Also, we designed 4 different characters and bosses with individual data(like health, damage, defense) and skills. 
We used socket and port number by using their IP address to connect to our server. We used XML files to record all the data for different characters. 
We want add new data or make any changes,so we used XML files.
